# cs290-portfolio-project
## Website project for CS 290
This project gave experience in developing a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project focused on the front end development of a website and did not implement any back end features typical in a normal website.

The website contains four pages that all have consistent styling but unique content. The main use of JavaScipt in the pages is for the slideshow animation on the homepage that cycles through a few different photos and for the switch between the projects and the courses tabs on the education page.
